I'm Matt Stark, a 26-year-old Scottish game developer. I'm fascinated by the process of making games, from both a technical and artistic perspective. I've been developing games in my free time for several years and I'm now studying Computer Game Technology at Abertay University. Some areas that particularly interest me include shader development, procedural generation and puzzle game mechanics.

I have a wide range of skills useful for game development, including C++, C#, Unity, Blender, GIMP and Inkscape. I have experience working alone and as part of a team, and have participated in several game jams, including Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare. I've also done freelance 3D modelling work.
