I'm a 25-year-old Scottish game developer who is passionate about creating games and art. I've been developing games in my free time for several years, and I'm now studying Computer Game Technology at Abertay University. I am fascinated by the process of making games, from both a technical and artistic perspective. Some areas that particularly interest me include procedural generation, shader development and puzzle game mechanics.

I have a wide range of skills useful for game development, including Unity, C#, C++, Blender, GIMP and Inkscape. I have experience working alone and as part of a team, and have participated in several game jams, including Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare.

I've also done freelance 3D modelling work. If you'd be interested in me doing 3D work for you, please contact me using the email address below.
