I'm Matt Stark, a 27-year-old Scottish game developer. I've been developing games in my free time for years and I studied Computer Game Technology at Abertay University. In early 2020 a video of a game prototype I was making went viral, and I dropped out of university to focus on developing the game that would later be named Viewfinder.

I'm fascinated by the process of making games, from both a technical and artistic perspective. Some areas that particularly interest me include shader development, procedural generation and puzzle game mechanics. I have a wide range of skills useful for game development, including C++, C#, Unity, Blender, GIMP and Inkscape. I have experience working alone and as part of a team, and have participated in many game jams, including Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare.
