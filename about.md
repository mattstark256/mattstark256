I'm a 25-year-old Scottish game developer who is passionate about creating games and art. I have been developing games in my free time for several years, and I'm now studying Game Design and Production at Abertay University.

I have a wide range of skills useful for game development, including Unity, C#, C++, Blender, GIMP and Inkscape. I have experience working alone and as part of a team, and I have participated in several game jams, including Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare.

Some areas that particularly interest me include procedural generation, shader development and puzzle game mechanics.
