Ice Cream Island is a game I created for the Ludum Dare 40 game jam in December 2017. The theme of the jam was "The more you have, the worse it is", so I decided to make a platformer where the player must avoid increasing numbers of seagulls as they collect ice creams. I made the game using Unity, which I had started learning a couple of months earlier.
