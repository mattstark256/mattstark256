Twisty Slidey Cube is a puzzle I made for Android using Unity which combines the mechanics of a Rubik's Cube and a sliding puzzle. One of the main challenges was finding a way that the player could rotate the view, rotate sections of the puzzle and slide sections of the puzzle using only touch inputs. The program supports puzzles of any size and each puzzle section can have a unique model.
