At Global Game Jam in January 2018 I worked as part of a team of 4 to make Bots In Us, a cyberpunk-themed survival game. The player controls an AI hivemind of nanobot-infected people. The hivemind is being hunted by government agents in a dark forest. The player must send individual people to lure agents away from the group and into bear traps.

Our team was made up of two artists, a programmer and myself. We decided to use 2D sketches in 3D space to create a visual style inspired by the game Don't Starve. The other team members hadn't used Unity before so I implemented the game's mechanics.

Many people played the game when we presented it at the end of the jam. We kept a scoreboard of the top scores, which encouraged people to try to find the best survival strategies. After the presentations everyone voted on their favourite game and we won!
