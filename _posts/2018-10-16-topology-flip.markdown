Topology Flip is a puzzle game I made for Android using Unity. It's a variation of Lights Out, where instead of using a 5 x 5 grid it uses various 3D surfaces. Different shapes require different strategies so the challenge of the game is to figure out how to solve progressively more difficult shapes.

The player can also visually customize the puzzle by choosing colours and images for the tiles.
