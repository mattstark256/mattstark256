In November 2018 I released a free Android game called Flux Rush. It's a puzzle-inspired endless runner where you re-arrange the track.

The track is procedurally generated so there is always a possible route. The title animation uses a shader which takes a texture with colour gradients and clips it by colour values which change with time.
