Laser Prospector is a mining game where the player can't mine. Instead they must build and maintain mining machinery and infrastructure. The game's score is the player's average mining rate, so they must focus on efficiency and on rapidly expanding their operations.

One of the biggest challenges was creating the inventory system, which, similar to Minecraft, allows the player to move stacks of items between slots, as well as being able to split stacks and move stacks between the inventory and a hotbar. Another challenge was creating the world generator, which uses Voronoi cells to generate a network of interconnected canyons.
